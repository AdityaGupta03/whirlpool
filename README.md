# Whirlpool - A C++ Library for Maelstrom

Please note that this is not yet completed and is currently being worked on.

This library provides a C++ interface for building distributed systems that can be tested with Maelstrom. It was inspired to solve the challenges listed on [Fly.io Distributed System Challenges](https://fly.io/dist-sys/).

This library provides an alternative C++ implementation focusing on modern C++ features and ease of use. While inspired by the official implementations, this is an independent project not affiliated with Maelstrom. You can find the library code within the "include" folder.

## Alternative Implementations

Maelstrom provides official implementations in several languages:
- [Official C++ Implementation](https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/tree/main/demo/cpp)
- [Official Go Implementation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/demo/go)
